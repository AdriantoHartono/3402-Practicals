## Learning Journal Week 3

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made a joomla website, and also reviewed some of the learning resources from youtube to helping make the website.
I learned some new things that I needed to know how to make a joomla website, which I think it will be useful for the assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 3 hours of my own time this week on this subject to make the website for this week practical.

### Content Insights
Putting some images were a good choice for the website page that targeting audience to visit because it can help to attract
the user's eye to visit and scroll through the website.

I made this wordpress website in order to practicing on how to use the website and operating some of the functions that provided there.
I have tried to make different layout from the default wordpress page, by using a blog template and edit some of the parts there. Moreover, I also
tried to upload some images from my own laptop and use the images there (in the wordpress website). In this practical, I'm more focused on how to use some of the
function in the wordpress rather than developing content and design for my site.
The goal of the website that I made is to increase the selling of flowers, because with the website we can help to make the customer to see the 
flower that we sell and they can order it also through the website when the website is already done.

I learned that to make website we need to prepare some site modules such as image and the content that we want to put in the banner, or bottom page. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as some 
of the way to make the banner page and uploading the image to some part that we want, which I think could be very useful in 
creating much better layout in my websites in the future.

### Group Formation Task
In this week practical we need to do some interview with some CP3402 students in order to make a group for the next assignment task.
Based on the interview that I have done from 6 people, I have choose 3 out of them. The 3 people that I have choose to become my group mates are
Joseph Paolo Tan, James Wongsonegoro, and Zaw Linn Htun Naing. The reasons why I choose them as my group mates are they have a willing to become responsible 
in doing the group task which will be very needed in every team in order to achieve the best result, and the next one is they have a same idea which can make us
become easier to handle the task later, and the last one is they all can accept other people opinion which will be very needed in every group in order to achieve 
the best outcome.
Here some of the questions that I used for the interview:
- What skills should a good Web Developer have?
- Are you aware of the roles and responsibilities of a Web Developer?
- What do you think the most important things that each member should have in order to produce a good outcome?
