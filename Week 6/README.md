## Learning Journal Week 6

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made a slack channel, github repository, and github project for the cms group project, and also I have reviewed some of the learning resources 
from youtube in order to helping link our slack channel group to our github repository group.
I learned some new things that I needed to know how to link slack channel to github repository, which I think it will be useful for the assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 1 hours and 30 minutes of my own time this week on this subject to make the website for this week practical.

### Content Insights
Linking slack channel to github repository really important for us, especially when we are doing a group project. It is important because
we can see the activity that we have done in the github repository from the slack channel (via message).

We made this slack channel in order to make our group become easier to communicate and contribute for the assignment project later.
In addition, we also make github repository in order to record what we have done, and we can just commit each work that we have done and we can track it from there.
We have connected the github repositoy to the slack channel, therefore if some of our members have commit any changes in the github repository, it can be noticed in the 
slack channel because there will be a message if there is a change from the github repository. Nevertheless, we also have made the github project in order to track
what things that we need to do, what things we are doing now, and what things that we have done.

Here are the step that we have done to link the slack channel to the github repository:
- Create the slack channel and github repository
- Open the slack website and click apps then search for github then add to slack
- Open the github on the slack app
- Write /github subscribe xxx (xxx refers to the repository name that we want to link it to)
- Click connect github account and then authorize slack by entering the verification code
- Click install github apps then select the repository that we want to link it to
- The slack channel has been linked to the github repository

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as we need to write
/github subscribe xxx (xxx referes to the github repository name) in the github apps in the slack website
in order to connect the slack channel to the github repository.
