## Learning Journal Week 2

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made a joomla website, and also reviewed some of the learning resources from youtube to helping make the website.
I learned some new things that I needed to know how to make a joomla website, which I think it will be useful for the assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 1 full day of my own time this week on this subject to make the website for this week practical.

### Content Insights
Putting some images were a good choice for the website page that targeting audience to visit because it can help to attract
the user's eye to visit and scroll through the website.

I made this joomla website in order to practicing on how to use the website and operating some of the functions that provided there.
I have tried to make different layout from the default joomla page, by using a blog template and edit some of the words. Moreover, I also
tried to upload 1 image from my own laptop and put use the image there (in the joomla website).

I learned that to make website we need to prepare some site modules such as image and the content that we want to put in the banner, or bottom page. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as some 
of the way to make the banner page and uploading the image to some part that we want, which I think could be very useful in 
creating much better layout in my websites in the future.
