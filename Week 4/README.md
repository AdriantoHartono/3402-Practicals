## Learning Journal Week 4

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made a local host website, and also reviewed some of the learning resources from youtube to helping install the local host and fix some of the problems.
I learned some new things that I needed to know how to fix some problems when making wordpress website in my local host, which I think 
it will be useful for the preparation on doing my next assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 3 hours of my own time this week on this subject to make the website for this week practical.

### Content Insights
Having our own local host can help us to access our website faster and more secured for us to use.

I made this local host website in order to practicing on how to make a website and operating it through my own local host.
I have tried to make wordpress website in my local host with the help of XAMPP apache distribution. Here are some step that I need to do in order to
make the wordpress website in my own local host: 
- Download and install XAMPP Apache from internet (XAMPP Apache is a most popular PHP development environment) 
- Downlaod and install wordpress
- Copy the wordpress file that has been downloaded
- Open desktop folder, then open xampp -> htdocs
- Paste the wordpress file into the htdocs
- Extract / unzip the wordpress file
- Open XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MYSQL
- Open website and write https://localhost/wordpress and click advanced
- Open another website and write https://localhost/phpmyadmin then create a new database and name it "newdb"
- Go back to the https://localhost/wordpress and fill the database name with "newdb" and the username with "root"
- Fill the site title, username, password, and email
- Move to the login page and fill your username and password
- You will move to your the dashboard page of wordpress website in your local host

I learned that to make this wordpress website in the local host we need to create the database first before we can make the website.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as some 
of the way to fix the problem when making the wordpress website in my local host and the way to install some apache into my
laptop which I think will be useful for my next assignment when it is need to made with my own local host.
