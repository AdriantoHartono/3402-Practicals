## Learning Journal Week 6

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made php code and also I have reviewed some of the learning resources from youtube in order to help on making the PHP code for the website.
I learned some new things that I needed to know, such as how to make the PHP code and what code that we need to put in the PHP code, 
which I think it will be useful for the assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 2 hours of my own time this week on this subject to make the php code for this week practical.

### Content Insights
PHP code is a programming language that can be used to create websites, not just that it also can be used to create appliation, customer relationship management systems and more.
PHP code also can be embedded into HTML.

We made this PHP code in order to making our website becoming much better which also needed for the assignment project later.
This PHP code can really helpful for us to making the website, because we can put anythings that we want to put in our website. 
Therefore, we can customizing our websites layout as same as what we what we have expected on what to be shown in the website.

There are several code that can be used in the PHP code, such as: 
- echo, which can be used to print word that we want to put in the website
- if/else, which can be used to make a decision in our code
- 'for', 'while', 'foreach', which are used for doing a repetition based on the statement that we want to give
- function with parameters , which can be used repeatly based on the function that has been made
- include, which can be used to including the other PHP code that we have been made in the PHP code

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as there are some code that we can use
in the PHP code like echo, if, else, for, while, foreach, function (parameter), and include.

### Group Project Work Report
We have made our first version PHP code for the PHP and CSS code. We have not done much things, because this is still the first version of the codes and
they all still not perfect yet. Therefore, we will fix, edit, and add more revision for the code later. You can check the code in this github repository link:
