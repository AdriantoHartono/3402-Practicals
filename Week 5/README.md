## Learning Journal Week 5

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made a joomla website, and also reviewed some of the learning resources from youtube to helping make the customization for the website and more information
about things that we can do using wordpress.
I learned some new things that I needed to know how to make a wordpress website, which I think it will be useful for the assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 2 hours of my own time this week on this subject to make the website for this week practical.

### Content Insights
Customizing some styles of font size, color, and background color were a good choice to making the website become much better and
unique (because it is different from other website).

I made this website style customization in order to practicing on how to customizing the website and making the website becoming as what I am expecting.
I have tried to make different custom style from the default one, by customzing the font background, font style, font color, and font size. 
Moreover, I also tried to set the background color to the color that I want, then I also tried a new thing which is a white space that can be used
to make a space between the first things to the other things become more far.

The goal of the customizing the website is to increase the website layout become much better and colorful. Moreover, with the customized function
we can make the website becoming as what we have expected (like from the color, font size, font style, and others).

I learned that to customizing a website we need to prepare a css file to customizing the font style, font size, background color, and others.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as some 
of the css code that used to customize some parts (like font style, font size and background color), which I think could be very useful in 
creating much better layout in my websites in the future.
