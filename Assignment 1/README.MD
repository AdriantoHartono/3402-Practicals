### Estimated Hours
I spent about total around 3 days of my own time this week on this assignment to make the websites for this assignment 1.

### Content Insights
Putting some images were a good choice for the website page that targeting audience to visit because it can help to attract
the user's eye to visit and scroll through the website

I made these joomla and wordpress website in order to finishing the assignment 1.
I have tried to make as similar as it can for both website (joomla and wordpress) eventhough there are some slightly different output, that may be caused by different CMS company.
Overall, I think both of my website has 95% same layout and all the content (text and media) that I put for both website all there are the same.

I learned that both joomla and wordpress may have a same function and used, but there are some slightly different things that each CMS company has.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the assignment, I started to review at youtube to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my assignment work. I did learn some new things that I would not know before, such as some 
of the way to make the banner page and uploading the image to some part that we want. Moreover, I also learned way to make the banner page and uploading the image 
to some part that we want, which I think could be very useful in creating much better layout in my websites in the future.

### Goals
I made this florist shop website in order to increase the florist selling by promoting it through our blog, and it also can help for people out there that
want to buy the flower but cannot come to the store. The site is needed to improve business by getting on the internet and get at least 20% more customers 
after the site is online. Moreover, the website will give a benefit for the client, because it can increase the popularity of the florist which can make lots of buyers. 

### Reflection and Insights
When I started building my websites using two different types of CMS, I discovered that WordPress, in my opinion, provides easier way to use than Joomla. In my opinion
Joomla can be easy to use for the expert, because when they already know every part in Joomla they can just do it like easily. But as a new user, I feel like wordpress
provide easier way for us to use it, because it feels like things that we have done before.
For the web hoster that I am using for this assignment is cloudaccess.host because they are offering free hosting and it can hosting both joomla & wordpress.
