## Learning Journal Week 1

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I made a florist shop website, and also reviewed some of the web design and development (CP1406) courses to helping make the website.
I learned again everything that I needed to know how to make a website, which I think it will be useful for the group assignment later.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about total 1 full day of my own time this week on this subject to make the website for this week practical.

### Content Insights
Colorful theme was a good choice for the florist shop website page that targeting audience in age of 18 - 45 years old, because it can help to attract
the user's eye to visit and scroll through the website.

I made this florist shop website in order to increase the florist selling by promoting it through our blog, and it also can help for people out there that
want to buy the flower but cannot come to the store. The site is needed to improve business by getting on the internet and get at least 20% more customers 
after the site is online. Moreover, the website will give a benefit for the client, because it can increase the popularity of the florist which can make lots of buyers.

I learned that to make website we need several files such as html, css, and others. 
We can use html to insert the main things that we want to put in the website, and to make the design 
better we can use css file, which will help to set the font preview, website background, and others.
We also can use js (java script) and php file to do put some coding for the website.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to review at the website design and development (CP1406) course to check if they provided additional perspectives based on
what I gained through my practical work. I did remember again some things that I would not remembered otherwise, such as some 
of the code that used in html and css files, which I think could be very useful in creating much better layout in my websites in 
the future.
